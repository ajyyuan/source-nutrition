# Source

## Overview

**Source** is an iOS app that turns photos of meals into **micronutrient insights**. It prioritizes vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and food quality over calories and macros.

Instead of asking *“How many calories did I eat?”*, Source answers:

> **“What did this food actually give my body?”**

The app is designed to be:

* Photo-first
* Low friction
* Honest about uncertainty
* Micronutrient-centric
* Built for real-world eating

Initial release targets **iOS only** and focuses on a tight, high-quality MVP.
Submission timing is intentionally **TBD** while we expand features and polish.
